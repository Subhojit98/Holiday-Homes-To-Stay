                            <p>Investors requiring our certificate as bankable security can request a Swiss ISIN number upon request. By default, our certificates are issued as book-entry securities to reduce the issuance costs further. Should you require bankability, the costs will be to the total product costs, resulting in a slightly lower annual return.</p>

                                Typically the annual fees are around 0.48% p.a. (external fees) for bankability. On top, the certificate holder will pay a custodian fee at his bank. Secondary transactions usually cost about 1% of the total volume. The fees are charged by third-party providers, and Amea has no control over the exact fees or future price increases. Therefore, the exact costs can only be terminated once we set up a bankable certificate issue.

                                The fees for the bankable certificate issue will be added to the total product costs. We, therefore, suggest working with the non-bankable issues we offer whenever possible.

                                For the performance of its business operations, the Issuer must rely to a considerable extent on financial resources made available to it either as equity or as borrowed capital. The willingness of investors to provide financial means to the Issuer or to invest in the Issuerâ€™s equity not only depends upon the Issuer operating successfully but also on general conditions in capital markets.

                                Should the Issuer not be able to raise the financial resources needed, then not all of the projects attempted by the Issuer can be achieved, which can have a negative impact on business operations and business profits.
